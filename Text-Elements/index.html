			<b>HTML</b> 3.2 was published as a W3C Recommendation. It
			was the first version developed and standardized
			exclusively by the <b>W3C</b>, as the <b>IETF</b> had
			closed its <b>HTML</b> <b>Working</b> <b>Group</b> on
			September 12, 1996. â€‹Initially code-named "Wilbur",
			<b>HTML</b> 3.2 dropped math formulas entirely, reconciled
			overlap among various proprietary extensions and adopted
			most of Netscape's visual markup tags.
			<strong><em>Netscape's blink</em></strong> element and
			<strong><em>Microsoft's</em></strong> marquee element were
			omitted due to a mutual agreement between the two
			companies.
		</p>
		<br />
		<p>
			A markup for mathematical formulas similar to that in HTML
			was not standardized until 14 months later in MathML.
